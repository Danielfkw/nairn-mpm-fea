<h1>Using Softening Laws</h1>

<p>Some materials allow the use of softening laws. The possible laws are described fully on the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Softening_Laws">OSUPDocs Wiki</a>. This section briefly lists the properties. Softening law properties are assigned within a material definition that uses the law:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Material Type='50' Name='Isotropic Softening'&gt;
         &#x22ee;
     &lt;SofteningI&gt;(Law_Name or number)&lt;/SofteningI&gt;
     (Law properties)
&lt;/Material&gt;
</pre>

<p>where the <code>SofteningI</code> command selects a law (using the law name or number from the table below) and note that a softening material may have more than one softening law. The law selection is followed by commands to set any properties specific to that law. Available <a href="definematl.html#SSSM">softening materials</a> can use softening laws.</p>

<p>The following table lists the available softening laws. All laws correspond to a monotonically decreasing function f(&delta;) with f(0) = 1 and f(&delta;<sub>max</sub>) = 0 where &delta;<sub>max</sub> is the maximum cracking strain. Click any one to see the law and the properties needed for that law.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Number</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="#linear"><code>Linear</code></a></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Linear softening law</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h2><a name="linear"></a>Linear Softening (number=1)</h2>

<p>The linear softening law is f(&delta;) = 1 - &delta;/&delta;<sub>max</sub>. The input property is:</p>

<ul>

<li>Gc - the toughness of the material is this law's failure mode (in <a href="units.html">energy release units</a>). The default is very large number which means the material will not soften after initiation of damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you do not enter &delta;<sub>max</sub>. It is determined at run time because it is affected by particle volume, initiation stress, and crack orientation.</p>
